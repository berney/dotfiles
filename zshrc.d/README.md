# `~/.zshrc.d/`

The `~/.zshrc` will load `*.zsh` files in here.

Files in this directory will be managed by the dotfiles repo.

## `~/.zshrc.d/private/`

This directory is ignored in git so will stay private to the localhost and won't get commited to the dotfiles repo.
Put host specific stuff you want to keep private in files in this directory.
